This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in `tidy_data.txt.


The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. tidy-data txt contains the mean and standard deviation of every measurement during each activity of every volunteer. Thus, each row represents one of the six activities and there are total 180 rows(6 rows for each volunteer). The ID of the subject is a integer from 1-30. There are 66 columns of the means and standard deviation of the measurement during each activity. Variable names are as follows:
